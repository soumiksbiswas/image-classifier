# Multi-Class Image Classification
## CNN | Computer Vision

• Developed a robust CNN model for accurate 4-class image classification, employing techniques like dropout and softmax in the final layer 

• Designed the model with an input image size set at 224×224, employing categorical cross-entropy loss, optimizing it with Adam optimizer 

• Attained an accuracy of 90% through the execution of a 100-epoch model training with a batch size of 32 and saved the model in h5 format
